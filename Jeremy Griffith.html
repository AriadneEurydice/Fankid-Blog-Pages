            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            The son of Chili Griffith and Georgia Herrscher, and the oldest child for both. This Dark type trainer
            originally wanted to become a member of Unova's Elite Four, but due to being the oldest in his family, he
            instead stayed home to help Chili. Outside of work, Jeremy likes to hang out with his friends and spends
            most of his time at the skatepark.

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            As the oldest child, Jeremy is very serious and often overprotective of his younger sisters. Unfortunately,
            Jeremy doesn't always extend this towards other girls in his life. Despite his rough exterior, Jeremy is
            still a good kid at heart, a hurt kid, but good. Growing up with a lot of instability in his life despite
            Chili's best efforts forced Jeremy to step up and shoulder responsibilities at a young age.


            <h3>Backstory</h3>
            It was an unseasonably hot summer in Iccirus City the year Jeremy was born, even the hospital's industrial
            air conditioners were fighting to give relief to the residents. It had been in the high ninties for three
            days by the time Jeremy was born.

            <p>From as far back as Jeremy can remember, it has always been him and his dad. Chili always reminds him
              that it's not completely true, that for a long time they lived with his grandparents, Seneca and Fletcher.
              And he does have pictures of him as a toddler with them- though he doesn't really remember them. Back
              then, Chili and Jeremy used to share single room. He doesn't exactly remember what it was like, with just
              him and his dad because by the time Jeremy was lucid, Isabella was already apart of his family unit.
            <p>

          <!--BIOGRAPHY-->
          <div class="biotxt">

            Jeremy is tall and lean. Due to the instability of his upbringing, he's slightly malnourished and in the
            lower end of weight for his height group. Despite this, Jeremy displays a natural athleticism. Although he
            dropped out of highschool early into his sophomore year, he kept his grades up enough to play in the
            school's baseball and boxing teams. He even made an attempt at football, but he prefers baseball. He is so
            stressed out his hair is "greying" or rather, coming in pink in random patches throughout his head.


            <h3>Scars:</h3>
            Due to the sheer amount of fights Jeremy has participated in, he's got plenty of scars but they aren't seen
            often. On the inside of both of his elbows, due to regularly donating plasma, Jeremy has small sunken scars.

            <h3>Main Outfit:</h3>
            <li><i>Jacket:</i> Leather Jacket with a crimson hoodie. Jeremy "won" (<s>stole</s>) his leather jacket
              after a
              fight at a bar.
            <li><i>Shirt:</i> Black T-shirt with the sleeves cut off
            <li><i>Jeans:</i> Light jeans
            <li><i>Shoes:</i> Knock-off Black Converse
            <li><i>Accessories:</i> Stainless steel hardware

            <h3>Illnesses:</h3>
            <li>Intermittent Explosive Disorder*
            <li>Borderline Personality Disorder (?)
              <p>
                From a young age Jeremy had terrible fits that were uncontrollable, often sudden and unprovoked and
                lasted for at the most, half an hour before they would stop due to fatigue. It often happens when Jeremy
                is in high stress environments such as school, or situations where he gets easily overwhelmed, and often
                times he can feel himself starting an episode.

              <p>It is suspected by a.. previous child psychologist that this behavior aligns with Jeremy's home life
                with the lack of security of food and shelter- even possible emotional abandonment. Suggestions of..
                relocation.. were made. (They stopped going after being told that.) Although research from a local
                library via outdated psychology textbooks has suggested that it is something that one grows out of,
                unfortunately for Jeremy (and those around him) he is an exception, though he does have a self-claimed
                “better grip.” He's prone to sudden outbursts of violence and uses sports as a.. creative outlet for his
                anger.

              <p>Due to having such intense mood swings, Jeremy often practices- fails, but practices in preparing
                himself for how he's going to react and tries to appear emotionless. But in reality, he is a pretty
                emotional guy. Due to being unable to regulate his own emotions it leaves him in a perpetual state of
                fight-or-flight which in turns, makes it worse. He's suspected of having <b>borderline personality
                  disorder</b> but Jer can neither care or afford the diagnostic testing and medications.

            <li>PTSD</li>
            <p>After Isabella's drowning incident when he was 11, Jeremy has recurring nightmares where he wasn't able
              to save her. When he was younger he used to combat this by going into her room and reassuring himself she
              was still there. Now that she's gone, he can't do that. He also has a fear of large bodies of water and
              cannot handle the cold.

            <li> Jeremy automatically reverts to using polite terms "ma'am" and "sir" and others when addressing anyone
              older than himself, even if he doesn't particulary care to be polite to the person.
            <li> When nervous, bored, mad, Jeremy has a habit to play with the rings on his fingers. Jeremy is never
              seen without them.
            <li> Jeremy doesn't nap, he will often just lay awake in silence to "recharge." He stopped napping after
              Bella drowned.
            <li> He's constantly on guard, highly aware of sounds and movements around him. He's a light sleeper.
              <h3>Extra:</h3>
            <li> Despite having a fear of needles and blood, Jeremy regularly donates plasma for extra cash.
            <li> Jeremy sometimes has terrible judgement.
            <li> Chili and Jeremy share a room and a bed, but often don't sleep at the same times due to conflicting
              schedules. (Thank Goodness. - J.) Jeremy was probably around nine the last time they officially shared the
              bed.

                <h3>Chili Griffith</h3>
                Jeremy's father. While Chili and Jeremy often don't see eye to eye when it comes to Jeremy's future (and
                wasted potential in school), they love each over very deeply and do their best to work together in order
                to make ends meet for the family. Growing up, Chili did his best to model responsibility, family, and
                duty to Jeremy. But watching his father struggle from day to day, Jeremy began to see that his father
                wasn't as perfect as he thought he was. This led Jeremy to secretly hold resentment for his uncles, who
                "never" made an effort to help Chili. Despite everything, Jeremy is very protective when it comes to his
                father.

                always take each other's side when in an argument with an outsider. Anna sometimes feels the need to
                give him unwarranted advice in the same way that she never listens to advice he gives her.

                Jeremy has fond memories of his childhood with Isabella. Two of the worst days of his entire life that
                come to mind is when he saved her from drowning and when she ran away to start her journey. Jeremy
                nearly followed her to Kalos but didn't after Anna convinced him that she would be okay on her own. He
                still worries
                about her and does his best to keep in contact with her and send her money when he can.

                official girlfriend. Now, Jeremy will admit, he wasn't the perfect boyfriend- but not to point fingers,
                Tatia wasn't exactly a perfect girlfriend either. He loved her so much it was driving him crazy. They
                were volatile, destined even. And on and off so often that Jeremy would forget if they were dating or if
                they were on a break. Doesn't matter- they couldn't keep away from each other anyways. Now, regrettably,
                it's over and he still loves her.

                Jeremy's love interest. There's always that rule in that you should never date your sister's best friend
                because it not only ruins their friendship, but that it ruins your relationship with your sibling.
                Jeremy never cared too much for that. Sterling was fun and kind for someone of her... background. And
                that's what she wanted, and what Jeremy wanted. They'd both ended relationships for the summer season
                and found each other, but it wasn't serious enough for them to want to stay together... right?

                not a good guy. Jeremy likes how respectful and responsible he is. He liked the way Spinner treated
                Anna, how he cared for her. He also admired just how cool he was, how he didn't take himself too
                seriously. He couldn't even be mad about Spinner's line of work, at least he had a job. A job is job,
                Jeremy respected the hustle.

                dating his daughter Tatia, Jeremy quickly began to look to Paul as a father figure. Not that
                there was anything wrong with his own, Paul was just different. He's someone that Jeremy really
                respects. Even after Tatia moved on from him, her family has never turned him away when he needed them.

                professionally trained, in that way Jeremy found her similar to Chili, and it was comforting. Throughout
                his relationship with Tatia, Mrs. Weiss had noticed her dishes deviate slightly from her mental
                receipes. Finally, she caught him doctoring her dishes when he thought no one was paying attention.
                Before he knew it, she had taken him under her wing and began to support his culinary dreams.

                either of them since he was 'bout 12 years old, and he hopes he never sees them again. He doesn't have
                good relationships with his cousins either. And don't even get him started on his aunt Aria.

                <h0>July 19th, 2018 - Jeremy is born. </h0><br>
                On the 19th day, a baby boy is born to Georgia Clarkson and Chili Griffith at Iccirus Medical Center @
                9:59 P.M. in Iccirus City, Unova. Chili is not present for his birth nor did he have any idea that
                Georgia was pregnant. While excited to meet him, Georgia quickly realizes that she is in over her head
                but chalks it up to nerves. She struggles to have a connection with her new baby.

                It's an unfortunate tuesday morning for Chili, he has missed his alarm, spilled egg yolk on his new
                shirt and it is his first day at new job. The rocky start to his day has given him anxiety, despite the
                setback he powers though and manages to make it to work with five minutes to spare. Halfway though his
                day, Chili recieves a distressed call from his sister in law Aria, telling him to come home. Not wanting
                to make a bad impression, Chili stays the entire day- shutting off his phone. By the time he is on the
                bus home, he's missed at least 20 calls from Aria and his brother Cilan. Once he's home he's met with
                Georgia.. and a baby. Georgia quickly explains that he's the father of her baby.. and tells him that she
                wants nothing to do with either of them. Five minutes later Georgia leaves and Chili is left with an
                unnamed baby boy and only a week's worth of formula.

                The adjustment period of being a new parent hit Chili like a train and lasted longer than expected. But
                it wasn't terrible.
                While Chili loved his baby almost instantly, he hadn't been able to find a name that suited the baby
                yet. Despite Cilan warning Chili that he wouldn't be able to help with the baby, Aria was willing to
                bend the rules a bit and help him. After a few weeks of caring for Jeremy with the help of Aria, Chili
                finally came to the conclusion that he would keep his son. The birth certificate stamped with ink
                imprints of the boy's feet had been sitting on his desk for months. He'd been trying out names for some
                time, changing every few days or so before finally he realized that the baby responded to one name.
                Jeremy. Chili filled in the baby's name box and signed the certificate so he could take it to be
                finalized..

                  <h4>With what seemed to be almost no warning- or maybe Chili had just been so busy it had slipped his
                    mind, Cilan and Aria began the process to move to Lumiose City, Kalos. Up until then, Aria had been
                    Chili's trusted babysitter as she hadn't minded- <i>or he thought she hadn't minded</i> taking care
                    of Jeremy while Chili was at work. He'd been paying her, just what he could afford to pay her and
                    she was a lot of help, but Cilan had been firm on not helping Chili with Jeremy's necessities.

                    <p>By April, Cilan and Aria had completed their move, leaving Chili and Jeremy in the home they had
                      all shared. After moving twice, Chili finally cut his losses and packed the family for New Tork
                      City so they could move in with his parents in order to be more financially stable and because his
                      parents, Seneca and Fletcher had been watching over Jeremy. It was just easier to live with them,
                      and allowed him and Jer to sleep in due to grandma and grandpa being across the hall rather than
                      across the city.

                The winter season meant the Griffith household was full of family now, especially with Cilan and Aria
                bringing along the newest addition of the family- Claudia. When Chili had gotten the call the night
                before, he'd been nervous to tell anyone and instead decided to leave the house early in order to pick
                up Isabella. After coming home with her it was well, a shock to the entire family, especially since this
                time she wasn't even Chili's. Aria in particular.. got.. upset that attention Claudia was recieving was
                stolen by a new baby girl. Jeremy already loved her, stopping his games every once and while to go and
                stare at his baby sister.

                were a sobering reality for Chili as he realized he could no longer leave them alone with the kids for
                long periods of time. When his father got sick with cancer, it put an even bigger strain on his limited

                especially daycare services, that had begun to pile up. The months leading up to the summer had hit him
                particulary hard making ends meet and slowly they had begun to rely more and more on the local food bank
                in downtown New Tork. After only a week in Lumiose, a an unexpected fight has Chili bring home Jeremy
                and Isabella early.

                Seconds. "That's all it takes." It's something Jeremy had heard over and over growing up, that it only
                takes seconds. The morning of Anna's adoption hearing Chili had woken him early so Jeremy could lock the
                door behind him. Jeremy stayed up for a bit after they left to get some chores done around the apartment
                before going back to bed. A few hours later, Jeremy finally dragged himself out of bed to make himself
                and Bella breakfast, after calling for her three seperate times he went to check her room. Not finding
                her, Jeremy hurried outside to see if he could find her, thankfully she and Simisear were skating on the
                pool which had frozen.

                <p>After calling her in for breakfast, Jeremy headed back in to finish serving the food. After waiting
                  another minute or two, Jeremy pulled on a jacket and headed back out outside- only this time Bella
                  wasn't anywhere to be seen. Simisear was running around the pool anxiously... and the ice was cracked.
                  Immediately Jeremy began running down the stairs, and across the court before jumping the fence.
                  Without hesitation, Jeremy jumped into the pool. The cold shocked him enough that he released all his
                  air and he hurried back up for a second before diving back down to pull her out. After about five
                  minutes of cpr, Bella finally threw up what seemed like half of the pool.
                <p>While breathing, Bella was still blue and barely conscious so Jeremy picked her up and hurried to the
                  nearest hospital. Once they arrived Jeremy was given dry clothes, socks, warm blankets and hot
                  chocolate as he waited for the doctors to finish working on her. The nurses all called him a hero
                  while reassuring him that it wasn't anybody's fault that this happened.</p>
